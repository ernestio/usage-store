### CI status
master: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ernestio/usage-store/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/ernestio/usage-store/tree/master)  | develop: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ernestio/usage-store/tree/develop.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/ernestio/usage-store/tree/develop)

### Description

Usage store is intended to be a data store to track the lifetime of specific resource types.
The database structure is basically an entry list of different timeframes where the specific entity was up and running.

Even you can interact as usual with this store through [its endpoints](main.go#L14)
```
usage.get
usage.del
usage.set
usage.find
```
the database population is done by listening at events happening on [Ernest](http://ernest.io) nats network. Usage store is listening at [this events](main.go#L48)

#### instance.create.*.done
Creates a new entry for the specific instance starting at the current time

#### instance.delete.*.done
Closes an existing entry

#### instance.update.*.done
Depending on the field `powered` [true|false] it will execute the same logic on the previous two, in case powered is not set it will skip any process.
